     <p>1   Module Summary

        The module builds on the requirements, process and data modelling skills introduced in the level 4 module.  Requirements and process modelling will be taken through the design stage with the development of different UML design models through to the implementation phase.  The development of conceptual data models will be covered in more depth and developed for database design and implementation.  Throughout, the module will focus on object-oriented analysis and design.

        2.1 Aims
         •   To enable students to use an object-oriented method for the analysis and design of software systems.
         •   To introduce techniques and models used in object oriented analysis and design.
         •   To improve students’ knowledge of database design.
         •   To develop the skills required to design and implement a database from conceptual modelling through to implementation.
         •   To understand the basic principles of relational databases and relational design 
         •   To consider the principles of database management systems

         2.2 Learning Outcomes

         On successful completion of the module, you will be able to:
         1.      Apply the essential principles of object-oriented analysis and design using UML.
         2.      Design object models for the logical layer of systems.
         3.  Design a conceptual data model that captures an organisation’s requirements for a database
         4.  Describe the relational data model and normalisation
         5.  Rapidly build efficient, and effective databases using SQL
         6.  Appreciate the role of data administration, security and recovery processes in database management systems.

     <p>4   Practical programme


Weekly worksheets will be available for each practical session, and you will be required to submit a piece of work via StudySpace for some of these sessions.



5   Assessment

5.1 Submission of coursework

Coursework must be submitted through studyspace.   All coursework and workshop exercises must be submitted by 23.59 on the day specified.


If you are ill or have problems affecting your studies, the University Mitigating Circumstances policy may apply.  You will need to complete a form and attach suitable independent documentation. Remember if you submit a piece of work or attend an examination, you have judged yourself fit to undertake the assessment and cannot claim mitigating circumstances retrospectively.

Further guidance on mitigating circumstances is available on the My Kingston site:
 My Kingston > My Faculty > Science, Engineering and Computing > SEC Student Support 

https://mykingston.kingston.ac.uk/myfaculty/sec/secstudentsupport/Pages/default.aspx


If you have not received feedback within the timeframe you expected then please send us the details – we need the module code and the date you submitted the work. We will then pick up your message and look into the matter.

5.2 Feedback on Assessment

This section describes how and when you will receive feedback on each of the assessment tasks. 

Assignments
Feedback comments will be visible through your grade book on studyspace. Generic feedback will also be given in the workshops sessions as well as feedforward feedback during the lectures. 

Examination 
Generic feedback on the examination will be posted on StudySpace


Late Feedback
We are committed to our students receiving timely feedback and would like to remind you that you can let us know of any delays that occur in receiving feedback from work you have submitted for marking. We have set up an electronic noticeboard for this purpose:
SEC_Assessment_Feedback_Delay_-_UG_NB@kingston.ac.uk


5.3 Format of Examination Paper

The end-of-module examination paper will be as follows.

Multiple choice exam (50 questions)
