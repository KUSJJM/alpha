     <p>MODULE SUMMARY (INDICATIVE)

       This module will be taken by all second year (level 5) students enrolled on Computer Science (except Games Programming), Software Engineering, and Joint Honours students. The module extends studentsâ€™ learning of the formal aspects of programming, including a comprehensive treatment of the object-oriented paradigm, selection and use of data structures, and algorithms for searching and sorting. It also enables students to become acquainted with the important tools available for programmers, such as development environments, revision control systems and code profiling and optimization techniques.

       MODULE DESCRIPTOR
       <br>
       For details of aims, learning outcomes, curriculum, learning and teaching strategy, assessment strategy and bibliography see CI5100 module descriptor appendix.
       MAJOR CATEGORIES OF ASSESSMENT
       <br>
       Submission of coursework
       <br>
       You should follow the instructions for coursework submission given in the coursework briefs.
       <br>
       You are reminded of the faculty policy for the late submission of coursework. Any work submitted up to a week late will be capped at 40%, anything submitted later than this will receive a zero mark.
       <br>
       If you are ill or have problems affecting your studies, the University Mitigating Circumstances policy may apply.  You will need to complete a form and attach suitable independent documentation. Remember if you submit a piece of work or attend an examination, you have judged yourself fit to undertake the assessment and cannot claim mitigating circumstances retrospectively.
       <br>
       Further guidance on mitigating circumstances is available on the My Kingston site:
       My Kingston > My Faculty > Science, Engineering and Computing > SEC Student Support 
       https://mykingston.kingston.ac.uk/myfaculty/sec/secstudentsupport/Pages/default.aspx

       Feedback on Assessment
       <br>
       This section describes how and when you will receive feedback on each of the assessment tasks. 
       <br>
       Coursework Assignments
       Feedback comments will be written on the cover sheet of your assignment. Generic feedback will also be given in one of the workshops sessions. 
       <br>
       In-class Tests
       Marks and Feedback are provided on In-class Tests, often automatically by the test system, else via Studyspace or e-mail.
       <br>
       Examination 
       Students are welcome to approach the module leader about feedback on their exam performance. Generic feedback on the examination will be posted on StudySpace.
       <br>
       In addition formative assessment is used to help students answer particular components of the assessment by giving them timely feedback on exercises specially designed to mimic the elements of the coursework assignments. These include a number of activities such as the production and presentation of design and code which contribute toward the coursework. Moreover, the programming exercises will help in the implementation part of the coursework.
