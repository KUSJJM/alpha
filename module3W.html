     <h3>Prototype Assessments</h3>
     <p>The assessments for the "Prototype" will be conducted tomorrow 3-5pm and Thursday 4-6, as per the usual timetable. Groups should arrive in the order of the schedule provided (see link below). Groups should arrive before their slot and wait outside the lab. They can enter the lab only a few minutes before their allocated time slot. We want each group to have turned on their computers and logged on and fired up all their documents by the time the assessors arrive to speak to them.

     PLEASE ENSURE that your name is properly allocated to the right group, reflecting the latest group formations. It is expected that you update your membership of the groups yourself.</p>

     <h3>CI5410 Group Project Plan Marks</h3>
     <p>Dear all

       The Project Plan marks have been released through My Grades. Please note that they are unmoderated and may change. In addition they are subject to group member adjustments where necessary.

       Well done

     <h3>In-Class Test and PIP Presentation Marks</h3>
     <p>Dear all
        <br>
      These are both available via 'My Grades' (the PIP was previously emailed to you). 
        <br>
       Go to 'My Grades' and select the 'Graded' Tab.
        <br>
       You will also be able to view your Group Project Plan and Feedback mark through the same view on Friday. I will announce when.
        <br>
       Any queries please contact me - my office hours are currently 11-2pm on Wednesdays.
        <br>
       Well done on the In-Class Test.
        <br>
       Best wishes
        <br>
